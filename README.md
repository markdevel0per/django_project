Hello. It is my pet-project that resembles an online store. To test the website, you should:

1. Download the folder and open it in your ide.

2. Change the current directory in your terminal to this folder.

3. If you haven't already installed Django and Python, do it.

4. Run "python manage.py migrate" and then run "python manage.py runsever" (all without quotes).

5. Test the website.
