Hello. It is my pet-project that resembles an online store. To test the website, you should:

1. Download the folder and open it in your ide.

2. Change the current directory in your terminal to this folder.

3. If you haven't already installed Django and Python, do it.

4. Download all the dependencies: write "pip install virtualenv" in your terminal, then "virtaulenv venv", "venv/Scripts/activate" and then "pip install -r req.txt" (all without quotes).

5. Run "python manage.py migrate" and then run "python manage.py runserver" (all without quotes).

6. Test the website.
